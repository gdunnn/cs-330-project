# cs-330-project
1. How do I approach designing software?
  
  * What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  
  This project has helped bolster my understanding of how to modularize code and make it more readable to potential teammates that WOULD read the code. 
  * What design process did you follow for your project work?
  
  There wasn't much of a design process other than a few time that I utilized pseudocode to gain a better understanding of how certain parts of my code was supposed to work. 
  * How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
  
  I can utilize the modularization and functionality standards that I have implemented in this project to transcend into literally anything I work on in the future. That was by far the most important aspect of this class that I have learned. 
2. How do I approach developing programs?
  * What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  
  I heavily utilized our materials that was given to us each module along with Youtube and StackOverflow. By using these references and my picture that I chose to design my 3D scene around, I was able to successfully prgram my 3D scene in the digital domain.
  * How did iteration factor into your development?
  
  Iteration through various modules inside of the code helped achieve the success of my project. By consolidatiang the the shader program I was able to iterate through it to automatically create the desired shaders for new lights and objects without having to redundantly write the shaders for each individual object added.
  * How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
  
  My approach developed tremendously throughout each milestone of this class. It is truly amazing to see how important it was to power through these and learn about every detail these modules encapsulated which eventually led to my successful completion of this final project. 
3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  * How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
  
  Although I cannot foresee my future in the computational graphics sector of computer science, I definitely feel like this class has strengthened my knowledge in C++ an the practices of it tenfold. I will definitely be able to utilize this knowledge in any language and any situation going forward with my prospective career in programming. 
  * How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
  
  Like I mentioned above, this class has definitely helped me tremendously in my programming and logical abilities, and I really feel like this is the biggest takeaway from this class for me personally. I think that learning how to create 3D scenes using the OpenGL library is invaluable and if I were ever to need to utilize this skill I feel confident that I would be able to figure it out, however I personally do not feel like OpenGL will be a huge roadblock for me in a professional career.
